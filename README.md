#Description
The goal of the stock market dashboard project is to build a web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal is to provide users with an easy platform to view and manage stock prices based on the company symbol (company stock name). The application uses the alphavantage.co API to retrieve stock data. Function highlights include creating API keys, using input fields for symbol selection, enabling users to choose when to select, viewing watchlist of selected stock, modal display detailed information in card selection , and have this stock taken off the watchlist.
